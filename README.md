# Football on the table
<img alt="Terraform Provider Manager Demo" src="/gif/for_program.gif"/>
Hello to you friends.

We made a table football game for two players.

This game is written in "Python" language.

This game is made from the "pygame" library and you need to install it to run the game.

**The game is such that a ball moves in a direction and you have to prevent the ball from moving towards your area with the character you have.**

**If the ball hits your boundary, the score will be recorded for the opponent.**

**You must fully protect your range.**

## Install "pygame"
```bash
$ pip install pygame
```
Try to make sure that the package manager is updated !

## How to play 

The player on the right should use the arrow keys on the keyboard.

**Up arrow key:** Moves the character up.

**Down arrow key:** Moves the character down.

And for the player on the left, **"W"** and **"S"** keys should be used to move.

**W key:** move the character up

**S key:** move the character down
